# Git Test

This repository was my very first experiment with Git and GitHub.  It contains a simple Hello Odin file and served as a sandbox to practise commands like `git add`, `commit`, `push`, and `pull`.  Every developer starts somewhere, and this tiny project marks the beginning of my version control journey.  Feel free to ignore it or use it as an example of how to set up a new repository and push code for the first time.
